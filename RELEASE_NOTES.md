# Chef Client Release Notes:

## Changed no_lazy_load config default to True

Previously the default behavior of chef-client was lazily synchronize cookbook files and templates as
they were actually used.  With this setting being true, all the files and templates in a cookbook will
be synchronized at the beginning of the chef-client run.  This avoids the problem where time-sensitive
URLs in the cookbook manifest may timeout before the `cookbook_file` or `template` resource is actually
converged.  Many users find the lazy behavior confusing as well and expect that the cookbook should
be fully synchronized at the start.

Some users who distribute large files via cookbooks may see performance issues with this turned on.  They
should disable the setting and go back to the old lazy behavior, or else refactor how they are doing
file distribution (using `remote_file` to download artifacts from S3 or a similar service is usually a
better approach, or individual large artifacts could be encapsulated into individual different cookbooks).

## Changed file_staging_uses_destdir config default to True

Staging into the system's tempdir (usually /tmp or /var/tmp) rather than the destination directory can
cause issues with permissions or available space.  It can also become problematic when doing cross-devices
renames which turn move operations into copy operations (using mv uses a new inode on Unix which avoids
ETXTBSY exceptions, while cp reuses the inode and can raise that error).  Staging the tempfile for the
Chef file providers into the destination directory solve these problems for users.  Windows ACLs on the
directory will also be inherited correctly.

## Removed Rest-Client dependency

- cookbooks that previously were able to use rest-client directly will now need to install it via `chef_gem "rest-client"`.
- cookbooks that were broken because of the version of rest-client that chef used will now be able to track and install whatever
  version that they depend on.

## Chef local mode port ranges

- to avoid crashes, by default, Chef will now scan a port range and take the first available port from 8889-9999.
- to change this behavior, you can pass --chef-zero-port=PORT_RANGE (for example, 10,20,30 or 10000-20000) or modify Chef::Config.chef_zero.port to be a port string, an enumerable of ports, or a single port number.
